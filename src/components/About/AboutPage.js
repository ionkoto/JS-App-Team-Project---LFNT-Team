                <h2>About LFNT Movie Database</h2>
                <p>The LFNT Movie Database is an online database of information related to films, television programs including production crew, fictional characters, biographies, plot summaries, reviews etc. operated by LFNT Team - Software University</p>
                    <p> Actors and crew can post their own résumé and upload photos of themselves for a yearly fee. U.S. users can view over 6,000 movies and television shows from CBS, Sony, and various independent filmmakers.</p>
                        <p> Launched in 2015 by computer programmer Pesho Peshev, the company was incorporated in Bulgaria as LFNT Movie Database Ltd with revenue generated through advertising, licensing and partnerships. In 2016 it became a subsidiary of Google.com, who were then able to use it as an advertising resource for selling DVDs and videotapes.</p>
                            <p> As of December 2016, LFNT Movie Database has approximately 10 titles (including episodes) and 7.6 personalities in its database,[2] as well as 17 million registered users. It is ranked 58 in Alexa Top Global sites ranking.</p>
                                <p> The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Although all data is claimed to be checked before going live, the system is in fact open to abuse and errors are rampant, especially in its catalog of older films. There is also much fancruft, including chat boards for every film and personality as well as general subject matter such as politics and religion. Users are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter ballot-stuffing.</p>
